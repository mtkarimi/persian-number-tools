## Convert Numbers to English or Persian in Texts

## Why Use This Function?

In applications that handle multilingual texts, especially ones that involve English, Persian, Arabic languages, and more, managing numbers can be challenging. Numbers may be represented in different scripts, which can cause inconsistencies in processing, displaying, or storing data. This function simplifies the conversion process by providing a straightforward way to normalize number representations across these languages.

## How to Use

The `convert_numbers_to_target_language` function is available in:
- [Python](/python.py)
- [C++](/C++.cpp)
- [Java](/java.java)
- [JavaScript](/javascript.js)
- [Go](/go.go)

It takes two parameters:

- `text`: The string containing mixed numbers (English, Persian, Arabic).
- `to_persian`: A boolean flag that controls the conversion direction. If `True`, all numbers are converted to Persian numerals; if `False`, to English numerals.

### Conversion to English

This is the default behavior. It converts all Persian and Arabic numbers in the given text to their English counterparts. This mode is useful for standardizing data for internal processing or when working with systems that only support English numerals.

#### Python Example

```python
test_text = "This is a test: English 123, Persian ۱۲۳, Arabic ١٢٣."
result_english = convert_numbers_to_target_language(test_text, to_persian=False)
print(result_english)  # Output: "This is a test: English 123, Persian 123, Arabic 123."
```

### Conversion to Persian

When the `to_persian` flag is set to `True`, the function converts all numbers to Persian numerals. This mode is particularly useful for applications targeting Persian-speaking users, ensuring that all numerical data is displayed in a familiar format.

#### Python Example

```python
result_persian = convert_numbers_to_target_language(test_text, to_persian=True)
print(result_persian)  # Output: "This is a test: English ۱۲۳, Persian ۱۲۳, Arabic ۱۲۳."
```

## Advantages

- **Simplicity**: A straightforward approach to handle multilingual number representations in texts across various programming languages.
- **Flexibility**: Easily switch between English and Persian numeral systems with a single function call, regardless of the programming language.
- **Utility**: Enhance the readability and consistency of numerical data in multilingual applications.

This function is a practical utility for developers working with internationalization and localization in multilingual applications, especially those involving English, Persian, Arabic languages, and more. It demonstrates cross-language support for a common functionality, making it easier for developers to implement and use in their diverse projects.
